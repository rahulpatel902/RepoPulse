## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RepoPulse.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd RepoPulse

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env.local file with your GitHub OAuth credentials
# GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
# GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
# NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## üîë Environment Variables

To run this project, you'll need to add the following environment variables to your .env.local file:

```
GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## üîí Authentication Flow

RepoPulse uses GitHub OAuth for authentication:

1. User clicks "Sign in with GitHub" on the landing page
2. User is redirected to GitHub for authorization
3. GitHub redirects back with a code
4. NextAuth.js exchanges the code for an access token
5. The token is securely stored in the session
6. The token is used for all GitHub API requests

- **Branch Management**: Monitor branch status with protection status and last commit information
- **Issue Tracking**: Filter issues by status (open/closed), labels, and search terms
- **PR Monitoring**: Track pull request status, reviews, and associated labels
- **Repository Health Score**: Composite score based on documentation, code quality, and activity metrics
- **Contributor Leaderboard**: See top contributors with contribution counts and avatars
- **Language Breakdown**: Visual representation of language distribution in repositories
- **Time-Range Selection**: Analyze repository activity over different time periods

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Sign in with GitHub**: Authenticate with your GitHub account using OAuth
2. **Add Repositories**: Search for and track repositories you contribute to or are interested in
3. **Monitor Activity**: Get real-time updates on repository activity with detailed views
4. **Analyze Metrics**: View interactive charts and visualizations of repository health and activity
5. **Manage Issues & PRs**: Track, filter, and manage issues and pull requests across repositories
6. **Check Repository Health**: Get insights into documentation quality, code practices, and activity metrics
7. **Track Releases**: Stay updated on new releases and version changes
8. **Monitor Branches**: Keep track of branch activity and protection status
